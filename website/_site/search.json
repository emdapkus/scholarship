The National Park Service publishes websites and physical cards explaining the principles of Leave No Trace (2022). The seven principles are:       - Plan Ahead and Prepare       - Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces       - Dispose of Waste Properly       - Leave What You Find       - Minimize Campfire Impacts       - Respect Wildlife       - Be Considerate of Other Visitors       (2022)\nYou can find more information about the principles here. While everyone exploring national parks and nature should know them all, the idea is to leave things the way you found them and ensure others can enjoy natural spaces as you did after you left.\nUnfortunately, we live in a world where people affect change in areas beyond where they live and visit. Industry changes have impacted the climate and conditions on the other side of the world. We can no longer ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the outdoors like we have without making some changes."

    "text": "Located in southeast Utah, Natural Bridges is the state’s First National Monument. Established in 1908, it gets its name from the park’s three extensive naturally occurring bridge-like features. The bridges, Sipapu, Owachomo, and Kachina, are named in honor of the Puebloans, an ancestral people who made the area their home between 7,000 Before Common Era (BCE) and 700 Common Era (CE). Natural Bridges is now maintained by the National Park Service (NPS). (2024)\nDespite being one of the lesser-known and visited National Monuments in Utah, Natural Bridges draws in 90,000 visitors annually (2014). While the three bridges are the main attraction, the park offers a diverse range of activities. Visitors can immerse themselves in the park’s natural beauty, explore its historical sites and artifacts, hike its trails, and camp under the starry skies. It is a national treasure that offers something for everyone, making it a must-visit and a cause worth conserving. (2024)"
